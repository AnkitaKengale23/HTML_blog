                <p>One of the historical tourist places in India, the Red Fort was constructed over ten years from 1638 to 1648.

This octagonal fort is one of the most famous historical places in north India and is also the site where the President gives his speech on Independence Day.</p>

                <h3>Qutub Minar, Delhi</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="des">
                <p>Regarded as the site of the first Muslim kingdom in northern India, the 
                    Qutub Minar is definitely one of the most historical sites in India. It is one of the 
                    finest examples of Indo-Muslim architecture with its intricate red sandstone storeys. 
                    These are dotted with carvings and verses from the Quran and are mostly in Arabic and Nagari. 
                    Qutub Minar is one of the famous historical places in India and is said to have got its 
                    name from Qutb-ud-din Aibak who was the first Muslim ruler of North India. 
                    The first mosque in India Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid is also located at the foot of the Qutub Minar. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="des">
                <p>The ‘Palace of Winds’ or Hawa Mahal gets its name due to the fact that it 
                    looks like a honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 intricate windows. It is also shaped like a 
                    crown as the ruler who built it, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, was a major devotee of Lord Krishna. 
                    One of the popular tourist places in Jaipur, this palace is known as 
                    the tallest building in the world that doesn’t have any foundation. 
                    The palace is curved but still stands firm due to its pyramidal shape.</p>

                <h3>Khajuraho Temples, Madhya Pradesh</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="des">
                <p>Khajuraho has always been thought of as the place that exemplifies sensuality and eroticism at its best. 
                    However this is a misrepresentation as only about 10 percent of the sculptures are sensual and the rest are common depictions. 
                    Countless sculptures depicting love, eternal grace, beauty, delicacy and the creative arts can be seen in one of the most 
                    historical places in India. A perfect amalgamation of Hinduism and Jainism, Khajuraho temples have carvings of cult icons, 
                    demi gods and Apsaras.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="des">
                <p>Built by the great ruler of the Ganga dynasty – King Narasimhadeva I, along with 1200 artisans, the Konark Temple is magic set 
                    in stone. Located on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, this temple signifies the exquisite detailing of ancient architecture and 
                    is one of the famous historical places in India. A particularly interesting feat is at the entrance of the temple where two 
                    lions are shown crushing elephants and a human body lies at the foot of the elephant.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="des">
                <p>You will feel like an ant climbing down an anthill when you explore the Rani ki Vav stepwell as it is a massive structure 
                    that is around 24 meters deep. One of the most unexplored historical places in India, this stepwell was built in the 11th 
                    century AD, as a memoriam for King Bhimdev of the Solanki dynasty by his wife Queen Udayamati. The lowest level of the stepwell 
                    was earlier used as a route to escape to neighbouring villages. It is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Gujarat.</p>

                <h3>Victoria Memorial, Kolkata</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="des">
                <p>The Victoria Memorial in Kolkata is one of the most historical tourist places in India and was built during the peak of the 
                    British era in India. The then Viceroy Lord Curzon laid down the idea of this monument but its actual design was done by Sir William Emerson.
                    Multitudes of lush gardens, a museum filled with British memorabilia including weapons, paintings, sculptures, artifacts etc and royal 
                    portrait of the Queen are what you will find in this beautiful monument. One of the best paintings you will find here is the one by Russian 
                    artist Vasili Verestchagin. This painting depicts the Prince of Wales in Jaipur in 1876.</p>
